  Discription: 
	tsp-3510.py -> python file with ant colony alorithm
	README.txt -> this text file with project information 
	mat-output.txt -> the output of our algorithm from mat-test.txt example
	algorithm.pfd -> algorithm discription and explination 

Project Instructions: 
	This project uses Numpy, scipy.spatial.distance, random and matplotlib. Make sure all these packages are installed for python3. The full list of import statments is as follows: 
	pprint, scipy.spatial.distance, numpy, time, random, operator, matplotlib.pyplot, warnings, mean from statistics 

	To run the ant colony algorithm, follow the command line suggestions from within the project file: 
	command line -> tsp-3510.py <input-coordinates.txt> <output.txt> <time-limit>

	If the algorith times out, the time out error (printed to the terminal) can indicate what went wrong. See the Algorithm.pdf doc for more information.
